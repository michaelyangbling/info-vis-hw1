All codes and figures in the jupyter notebook with corresponding headings.

# problem 1

well, 50 points...

There are roughly seven billion people in the world today. Which map shows where people live? 

1 billion in the Americas, 1 billion in Europe (including Russia and Turkey), 1 Billion in Africa, 4 billion in Australia and Asia


codes, figure and outputs in problem 1's jupyter notebook.


# problem 2
 I choose to do total GDP but not per capita, since total GDP represents the overall global impact from a country/ continent. 
 
 Each color( each continent) in the plot represents the total gdp after inflation adjustment vs time.
 
 Some country codes are mismatched and eliminated.
 
 GDP suddenly increases more rapidly for almost all continents around 1950, after world war 2. 
 
 There is almost no deviation from this trend.
 
 Caveat is that this is total but not GDP per capita, where we need any country's population at any time, and I cannot find that data.
 
 
# problem 3

  change of GDP with respect to time for each continent( each color ) is shown in problem 2.
  mean life expectancy ( divided by number of coutries in that continent )with respect to time always increases, for each continent, except for time in world war 1 and 2. The outlier is NA( North America) and SA( South america), which means they are not influenced so much by world wars.
  
  mean mortality, per 1000 people,  ( divided by number of coutries in that continent ) after world war 2 increases for a short time and then decreases for all continents. The outlier is Oceania, which has not data until 1970.
  
# problem 4

variable 1: country ( converted to continent)

variable 2: hiv ratio, per 100 people, between 15 and 49

hiv ratio( divided by number of coutries in that continent ) in Africa is much highier.

Genrally, Hiv ratio in multiple continents increases in 1990 and then slowly decreases to stability.


# problem 5
I used static plots.

advantage of interactive visualization: 
1.Can show more contents by putting the time dimension into a video animation.
2. Can impress the audience
3. can even show speed of some growth by video

advantage of static visualization: 
1, suitable for printed materials like books.
2, saves time and easier to visualize for low-dimension data
